Actually need a bit of help here; 

First; Hello, I'm MORGAN @ RUNTCPIP.COM

Second; I would like there to be 2 boxes per column; In this instance, the Frozen panel would be to the right of the Baymax panel, and the other two would be in their own rows.

I think I would have to make these completely seperate grid divs that would be 1x2; Do you have any suggestions?
